## Usage and Examples

Please run tests for each data structure by using the command `$ npm test` on the command line.
All tests should pass.

- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]
- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]

**Proper dependency management**
- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]

**Good project management**
- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]
- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]
- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]
